Introduction
------------

Hey there, it's nice to meet you! 
This document provides an overview of how I like to work.

Goals
-----

My primary goals to fostering a great working environment are:

1. **Collaboration:** Everyone's input is valuable, and sharing of ideas is how I see us thriving.

2. **Communication:** To keep everyone informed and aligned, let's maintain open and transparent communication in all channels.

3. **Empathy:** Working together is new to both of us and there may be challenges as we learn. Let's try to put ourselves in each others shoes.


Expectations
------------

Clear expectations takes the guess work out of our collaborations and reduce project anxieties:

- **Responsibilities:** Let's define roles and responsibilities clearly for each team member so that everyone understands their role in the project.

- **Communication:** Let's norm on how we plan to communicate prior to the challenge, the tools we'll use  to communicate (e.g., email, chat, video calls), and expectations for how frequently we should be checking communication channels.

- **Deadlines:** I like setting time blocks for myself and find it really helpful when deadlines for work is communicated clearly.

- **Feedback:** Feedback that is constructive and relevant is really helpful. It also is good if we can establish how much feedback to give, hence the "relevant" part, in order to keep the work moving. Also, I expect that if I receive feedback it is okay to offer constructive feedback as well.

Receiving and Giving Praise
---------------------------
- Feel free to send me praise 1 on 1 or in public. It's nice to be acknowledged for work well done.

- Unless otherwise specified, I like to give praise either 1 on 1 or in public (e.g. a Teams message or video calls)
